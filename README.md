Pandas Learning Notebooks

My short collection of Jupyter notebooks and sample data for learning pandas. Covers Series, DataFrame, cleaning, grouping, pivoting, visualization, and merging.

Usage
- Start Jupyter Lab or Notebook: `jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook`.
- Open any `*.ipynb` file and run the cells.

Structure
- `*.ipynb` — numbered notebooks covering topics in order (01 → 16).
- `pandas_tutorial.ipynb` — consolidated tutorial and examples.
- `*.csv`, `*.json` — sample datasets used by notebooks.
- `README.md` — project summary and quick start.

Notes
- Intended for learning and experimentation. Requires Python with `pandas` installed.
